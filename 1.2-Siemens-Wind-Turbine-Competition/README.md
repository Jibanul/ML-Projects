## üèÜ Competition Objective  

The **Siemens 2017 Wind Analytics Contest** aimed to analyze wind turbine operational data to uncover patterns leading to maintenance visits. Wind turbines generate logs of events, warnings, and faults, some causing shutdowns that require technician intervention.  


### üîπ Key Goals:
This project focuses on identifying patterns and trends in wind turbine failures using data-driven methods:
- **Detect failure patterns** by analyzing pre-visit alarm sequences.
- **Cluster and classify** turbine visit occurrences.
- **Analyze warning and shutdown frequencies** for predictive insights.
- **Identify correlations** between turbine events and technician visits.


This project applies **statistical and machine learning techniques** to enhance **predictive maintenance strategies**, improving wind turbine reliability and efficiency.  

## Code Files

1. **Finalcodefile.R**
   - Main analysis file
   - Runtime: ~30 minutes (Intel i7, 16GB RAM)
   - Requirements:
     - Change file paths and names at beginning of file
     - May need to install additional R packages
   - Outputs: Various plots and transition matrices

2. **Cluster.R**
   - Contains clustering and social network analysis
   - Requirements:
     - Set `path1` variable to data directory
     - Load 7 transition matrices (can be generated from Finalcodefile.R)
     - Load 3 original datasets
     - Load "Kcode.csv" (manual error code grouping)
   - Recommended to run step-by-step (Parts 1-13) for clarity.
   - Runtime: Few seconds per part
   - Outputs: Plots, graphs, CSV tables

3. **SPatterns.R**
   - Sequential pattern mining analysis
   - Requirements:
     - Change `path1` to data folder
   - Runtime: ~30 minutes
   - Outputs: R tables
   - Progress indicator included in loop

4. **ASRM.R**
   - Association rule mining
   - Runtime: ~5 minutes
   - Outputs: Graphs and R tables

5. **Association test and ANOVA-LSD-Boxplot**
   - Statistical analysis
   - Requirements:
     - Update data import directory
     - Uses Visit_data and Pattern_data with new variables
   - Runtime: Several hours

## Required Datasets

Place these in your data directory:
- All_Sites_Together_encoded.csv
- Codes_and_Event_Warning_Stop_classification.csv
- reccode.csv
- recvis.csv
- Kcode.csv
- Generated transition matrices

## Dependencies

Required R packages:
```r
stringr
arules
reshape2
ggplot2
lavaan
semPlot
mnlogit
mlogit
AER
nnet
```

## Running Order

While files can be run independently using provided datasets, the recommended order is:
1. Finalcodefile.R (generates transition matrices)
2. Cluster.R
3. SPatterns.R
4. ASRM.R
5. Association tests and ANOVA analysis

## Output Structure

The code will generate outputs in two main directories:
- `/Output/table/` - For data tables and CSV files
- `/Output/Plot/` - For generated plots and visualizations

Make sure these directories exist or modify the paths in the code accordingly.

## ‚ö†Ô∏è Data Availability
**Important:** The wind turbine data used in this analysis is **proprietary** and belongs to **Siemens Energy**.  
Due to **confidentiality agreements**, the original datasets **cannot be shared**.  
However, the code is provided for **educational and demonstration purposes**.
