# 🧠 Machine Learning Projects Repository

Welcome to my **Machine Learning Projects** repository! This repo contains various ML projects that I have worked on during my graduate studies and beyond. The projects cover a wide range of topics, from traditional data science models to AI applications involving unstructured data such as images, videos, and text.

<!--
🚧 **Work in Progress:** I am in the process of adding and organizing projects. More updates will be coming soon!

## 📂 **Project Organization**
Each project is structured as a separate folder, following a numerical system for easy navigation:

- **1.x - Traditional Machine Learning (Data Science)**
  - Includes projects related to structured data, tabular datasets, and classical ML techniques.
  - Examples: Regression, Classification, Time Series Forecasting, Feature Engineering.

- **2.x - AI for Unstructured Data (Images, Videos, Text)**
  - Focuses on Deep Learning, Computer Vision, Natural Language Processing, and advanced AI models.
  - Examples: Object Detection, Image Segmentation, Text Summarization, Video Analysis.
